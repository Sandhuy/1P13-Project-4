##Auxilium##

This design project focused on designing a real-world solution to a local Hamilton resident Alannah, who suffers from multiple health issues. Our group's design was to create a toy sucking robot that would go around her home and collect her childrens toys. It then extends to Alannah's range to be comfortability emptied. We designed a fully functional CAD model using Inventor and a possible GUI for a phone app she could use to deploy the robot.
